           <mark>Emilia is a beautiful half-elf with long silver hair and purple-blue eyes</mark>. She wears a white and purple outfit along with a white flower in her hair. Although she appears to be in her late teens, Emilia's chronological age remains unknown, though mentally she has been stated to be in her early to mid teens. She has styled her hair in a variety of ways, as per her contract with Puck, the Great Spirit of Fire was the one who arranged her hairstyle.

When Emilia still lived in Elior Forest as a child, she had a different set of clothes with the same colour pattern. She had a light green ribbon instead of her necklace, a different flower in her hair, and could be seen wearing a light-purple headband.

        <h3 id="personality"> Personality</h3>
        <p >
            Emilia is a very good-natured and energetic girl who likes to take care of others, though she herself sometimes refuses to admit this, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness or something everyone would do in her position despite that often not being true. Because of this, Emilia closed herself from others and not trusting people with her emotions or how she felt about different things and situations she was subjected to, as she was always of the mindset to eat it up and appear strong. This resulted in her being extremely fragile on the inside which in turned caused her to be overly childish about certain things and subjects. This led her to always relying on other people such as Puck or Subaru. Though this somewhat worked out in the first three Arcs, Emilia quickly hit a dead end in Arc 4 when she was forced to stand up for herself and stop relying on others if she wanted to overcome the predicament at the Sanctuary. A mixture of the unbearable first trial and the sudden tearing of hers and Puck's contract resulted in Emilia hitting her lowest point. Luckily, with a great deal of Subaru's and Puck's help, she was able to stand up and challenge her painful past in order to overcome the three trials presented by the Witch of Greed.

Upon overcoming the trials and liberating the Sanctuary, Emilia developed a great deal of self-confidence and greatly improved her self-image even after her contract with Puck was severed, forcing her to break out of her shell and live on her own. This change can be super evident in the starting chapters of Arc 5, where some characters even point it out, and, according to Heinkel Astrea, the rumours surrounding her don't seem to be true anymore–namely, her timidness and indecisiveness she was known for around the Kingdom, was nowhere to be seen.

Emilia has a tendency to use a lot of archaic words, such as "dunderhead" or the likes. This quirk of hers is mostly pointed out by Subaru, who now and then teases her about it, though Emilia doesn't pay much attention to it anymore. Furthermore, Emilia also has a strong tendency to drag our words when she really means it (best example of this would be the numerous times she dragged out the word "really" into "reaaaaaally" usually when talking about her feelings for or towards something or someone), which can be best observed when she's talking about something dear or important to her. This quirk was likely picked up from Fortuna. Her view on the world and human relations is also rather childish and easy-going, though following her major character shift following the end of Arc 4, she learned how to balance that shortcoming out with a level of professionalism and a unique air of authority.

Just like the other four Royal Selection Candidates, Emilia is also driven by a strong motive which shapes most of her actions, be it rational or irrational. Following her awakening by Puck in Elior Forest, she desperately tried to do something about the frozen elves in the forest. She cleaned them daily, talked to them, and spent a great deal of time and effort with them, trying to somehow get rid of their icy fate to absolutely no avail. However, a couple of months before the start of the main story, she was visited by an eccentric mage who introduced himself as Roswaal L Mathers. Though they initially started off on the wrong foot which caused Roswaal and Puck to fight for half a day, the two decided to form a truce, and Roswaal presented Emilia with a plan that would allow her to unfreeze her people in the frozen Forest. By becoming the 42nd King of the Dragon Kingdom of Lugunica, Emilia would gain access to the Dragon's Blood locked up in the vaults of the Royal Castle. The Blood is said to have magical properties, and it could be able unfreeze the frozen inhabitants of the Great Elior Forest. Emilia hastily accepted the offer and decided to participate in the Royal Selection and forging a goal of having the Kingdom be equal and free from prejudice.

        <h3 id="history"> History</h3>
        <p >
            About a century ago, Emilia lived with her aunt on her father's side, Fortuna, in Elior Forest.[1] For reasons not known to her, she was considered a rather special child and was subsequently forced to spend most of her days isolated from the other elven villagers in a place called the "Princess Room" with only Fortuna and her dolls as company. Eventually, her frustrations reached a boiling point, a,nd in an act of defiance, she broke her promise to not leave her room only to venture into the forest to search for everyone. Free to do what she wanted and not holding obligations that were never explained to her, Emilia snuck out on several occasions while hiding the fact, doing everything from exploring to behaving mischievously. It was in this room she discovered she had an affinity for spirits, and summoned countless Lesser Spirits to play with her. She did not realize how rare the ability was and referred to them as fairies.

            </p>
            <p>
                One day, she snuck into the centre of the village and witnessed strange men giving supplies such as food and clothes to the elves. Emilia then witnessed a tall, green-haired man idly chatting with Fortuna, with her calling him Geuse. Emilia started to view him as a rival for Fortuna's affection, as Fortuna made a "special face" at him and smiled, expressions which she only showed to Emilia, as well as having everyone in the village meet them, leaving her in the Princess Room. She overheard Geuse asking about her safety, and then asking her about a mysterious seal which was supposedly kept safe somewhere in the forest. After sneaking back into the Princess Room and being visited by Fortuna, she set out to find this seal, and trekked through the forest, led by the Lesser Spirits who showed her the way. She finally came to a clearing deep within the forest. Before her, stood a pair of huge metal doors that stood by themselves. Deducing that this was the "seal" everyone was talking about, Emilia–now satisfied–decided to head back to her room. By chance, she ran into Geuse, who was strolling around in the forest. When Geuse saw her, he wept tears of joy, leading to Emilia forgiving him. It's unknown how many times following their first interaction, Emilia and Geuse spent time together, however, some time later, the duo–together with Fortuna, who supposedly quickly caught wind of Geuse's and Emilia's meeting–, went on a walk around the forest. There, Emilia revealed her fairy-friends, leaving both Fortuna and Geuse in utter shock. When the two argued about how she could develop her potential abilities as a Spirit Art User, Emilia commented how they were like her parents, which left Fortuna greatly embarrassed. When Fortuna asked her to return to the Princess Room, Emilia made her promise to let her see Geuse again.
            </p>
           <p> 
            Just as she was about to leave, however, disaster struck and Emilia's life was changed forever. A white haired figure stopped in front of them, an introduced themselves as the Sin Archbishop of Greed, Regulus Corneas. Geuse demanded to know why he came, stating that Regulus had broken their agreement,[2] and that they could have discussed this back at their Church,[3] but every complaint was swiftly countered by Regulus to no avail. 
           
            As Fortuna held Emilia, another figure revealed themselves–Pandora, the Witch of Vainglory–stating she has come to open the mysterious seal of Elior Forest. When Fortuna saw Pandora, she flew into a fit of rage, stating that she would avenge her brother and sent a huge hurdle of Ice Spikes flying her way. Upon seeing her initial attack has no effect on her, Fortuna proceeded to summon a huge mass of ice and dropped it onto the pair's heads, crushing them to death. However, as the ice shattered into pieces, Regulus stepped forth, not a scratch on him or on Pandora. Geuse then ordered Fortuna to escape with Emilia, saying that their lives were more important than vengeance. As Fortuna ran with Emilia, she witnessed Geuse remove a strange box from his robes, containing an unknown essence. Emilia then screamed, as Geuse slammed the box up to his chest and absorbed the contents, gaining the Authority of Sloth.
            
             </p>As Fortuna ran deep into the forest, she stated that she would go back to save Geuse. Emilia begged Fortuna not to leave her, but Fortuna said she would be safe. Arch suddenly arrived, and informed her that Geuse's men and the elves were repelling the attack from the assailants. Fortuna then apologized to him for bringing Emilia and herself to the village and burdening them, a notion Arch immediately denied, saying they had helped them. Fortuna then declared she would defend the forest and protect the seal, entrusting Emilia to Arch, promising to her that they would always be together, and then heading back toward Geuse. As Arch ran through the forest, they encountered a black robed man, and prepared to attack him, before he stated that he was one of Petelgeuse's fingers. The member then revealed that the Radical Faction, their Leader, the Witch of Vainglory and the Demon Beast, the Kurohebi, had arrived to the village. When Arch expressed disbelief, stating it was neigh uncontrollable, the Cultist confirmed Arch's statement, and adding that Pandora possessed the power to vaguely guide it to a general location. The forest then erupted around them, with Arch cursing himself, realizing they had stumbled onto its hunting grounds. The Cultist was suddenly licked by something ominous–he immediately recognised it as the Kurohebi. As Arch attempted to save him, the Cultist told Arch to run, saying that it was too late for him, as the Kurohebi's poison consumed him, withering his body away, until he died before Arch's eyes. Arch turned around and darted deeper into the woods, however, not long after, something entangled his legs and the two fell–Kurohebi had made physical contact with Arch. Realising what has happened, Arch hugged Emilia close to his chest and immediately severed his leg above the knee with Wind Magic and cauterised it with Fire Magic, however, he was too late. The poison had already started to consume his body. Arch, knowing his fate was sealed, ordered Emilia to run towards a nearby patch of flowers, which she did without a second guess. As Emilia ran far beyond the flowers she was sent to, the Lesser Spirits revealed themselves again, and flew away, almost as if wanting Emilia to follow them–which she naively did.
            
            The spirits led her back to the Seal in the depths of Elior Forest. There, Pandora stood, arms wide spread. She then revealed she had been controlling the spirits the entire time, helping her locate the Seal. Pandora then asked her to open the seal, to which Emilia responded she couldn't. The Witch naturally didn't react nicely to that, stating she would rip the forest from the ground-up if she didn't, and also stated Fortuna and Geuse are okay, and that she would leave the forest if Emilia listened to her and gave her what she was asking for. Emilia then discovered she indeed possessed the key to the door,[4] but then remembered Fortuna had made her promise never to open the Seal. Before Pandora could react, Fortuna arrived and assaulted Pandora, saying she would not let her harm Emilia. Pandora merely smiled and kept reverting her own death, every time Fortuna had killer her. Shortly after Fortuna, Geuse had made contact with the group as well. The two confirmed Emilia's safety and Pandora's presence, and vowed to end it together. As Fortuna rushed forward and engaged in further one-sided slaughter with Pandora, the Witch used her Authority of Vainglory one last time, to trick Geuse's eyes, resulting in him tearing a hole in Fortuna's chest, inflicting mortal and irreparable wounds to Emilia's aunt. Geuse, realizing what he had done, snapped. With his reason for fighting lying in a pool of blood, he succumbed to the effects of the Witch Factor of Sloth, as his mind shattered beyond repair. Mere moments before Fortuna passed away, she told Emilia one last time that she loved her very much. Emilia, enraged, unleashed her full magic and attacked Pandora continuously, killing her over and over again as she used her Authority of Vainglory to rewrite her death. Emilia then lost control, and froze Elior Forest entirely, ending the bloodbath at Elior Forest. The last thing she could see before falling asleep, were Pandora and Geuse–now Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti, the newly-born Sin Archbishop of Sloth, leaving the forest together.
            
            Roughly seven years before the start of the Royal Selection, the ice around Emilia melted and Emilia met Puck. The two began to live in the now snow-covered Elior Forest. Exposed to the outside world for some time now, Emilia came to face the hostile reality of what it meant to be a half-elf in the world, especially one with her appearance which was nearly identical to that of the infamous Witch of Envy. Following those days, she suffered many hardships, not just from neighbourhood human towns that feared her, hated her, betrayed her, and attempted to sell her into slavery, but even from higher beings such as one of the Four Great Spirits–Melakuera–governed over Fire who sought to exterminate her for the crime of her existence and dangerous power that slept within her. Because of these issues, Emilia minimized any contact with outsiders, sticking to a frugal life by only leaving the forest to trade the magic stones she could find with people willing to deal with her in nearby towns for food and clothing. Humans, who called her the Witch of Frost, mostly tried to avoid her when she came around, but other than these excursions, Emilia would otherwise stay with the frozen elves as a guardian, as they were connected to her past. After the harrowing incident with Melakuera, Emilia formed a contract with Puck to preserve his life after his Od had been damaged. Puck then began to act as her surrogate father and mentor. He used the contract itself to seal parts of her memories that had been tampered with by Pandora.[5]
            
            A year before Subaru arrived, she and Puck were visited by an eccentric man who named himself Roswaal L Mathers, the first human who didn't react negatively to her appearance. He then invited her to the Royal Selection after being chosen by the Dragon Jewel by giving her a way to save the citizens of Elior Forest, through the usage of the Dragon's Blood.[6]
